          <h1>Welcome!</h1>
          <p>I'm Troy Baker, computer science professional with a masters in CS. I have a strong background in <em>machine learning</em>, <em>theory of computation</em>, and <em>computer graphics</em>. But recently I've decided to expand beyond academia (leaving behind my little PhD cubby) to develop skills for my real passions, <em>software architecture</em> and <em>program management</em>.</p>

          <p>For the past 3&#189; years, I have been in graduate school working towards a PhD, researching <em>rigidity theory</em> (in the field of combinatorial geometry.) In addition to the purely theoretical aspect of this research, I also spent time developing novel algorithms and working on several programming projects of various scale. Through this work, I realized it was the <i>engineering</i> aspect of computer science I enjoyed. I also developed a passion for teaching, which I have found to be invaluable in every setting.</p>

          <p>Whether it's new academic pursuits, rock climbing, fencing, teaching, things too nerdy to mention... when I am passionate, I dedicate myself to learning and practicing. I am always trying to broaden my worldview. For me, computer science brings together so many opportunities that make me passionate.</p>
