        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
          I'm Troy Baker, computer science professional with a masters in CS.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a professional, I've worked at Google and Sandia National Laboratories. I've been a full stack developer
          and developed a passion for <em>web design</em>, <em>database design</em>, <em>software architecture</em>, and
          <em>authentication &amp; authorization</em>. I contribute a strong vision and leadership to the projects
          in which I'm involved. My passion is designing solutions that deliver exceptional user experience and ease of
          use.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a student, I developed a strong background in <em>machine learning</em>, <em>theory of computation</em>,
          and <em>computer graphics</em>. In graduate school, I researched <em>rigidity theory</em> (in the field of
          combinatorial geometry.) In addition to the purely theoretical aspect of this research, I also spent time
          developing novel algorithms and working on several programming projects of various scale. I also developed a
          passion for teaching, which I have found to be invaluable in every setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          To me, computer science is more than a job. It is the best way to be a perpetual student and to express myself
          creatively. Every project provides the chance to learn things both inside and outside my domain. It gives me
          the freedom to invent and design solutions that work for myself and others. I take great pride in what I
          create and am grateful for every opportunity I have to pursue this passion.
