            which demonstrate the algorithms. Used to quickly find realizations of rigid, 2D bar-joint graphs. This was
            my personal project in the PhD program, for which I developed the theory and algorithm, which is suitable
            for industry CAD software. I independently coded and architected the software that implements the algorithm
            and provides a graphical interface. See publications for related papers.

            Visit the project <a href="http://bitbucket.org/geoplexity/easal">on BitBucket</a>. Used to explore the
            assembly landscape of molecules (and other physical structures.) I led the redesign of the UI and the
            refactorization and restructuring of the codebase, which has been in development for ~10 years with ~5
            active contributors, allowing for accelerated development with undergraduate students. I also helped write
            the user guide and feature summary (see publications.)

            An independent project. A web based deck-building card game. The game logic is mostly functional,
            implemented in Kotlin, allowing replay of the entire game state. The logic of individual game cards is
            implemented in a custom language, parsed by ANTLR. Multiplayer asynchronous gameplay is enabled by
            WebSockets. The UI is an entirely custom design, implemented in Typescript with the Angular framework.
            Deployed to Google Cloud Kubernetes, but currently in development and not available for use.

            An independent project. Implemented in C++ from the ground up (using only minimal windowing and asset
            loading libraries.) Helped develop a deep understanding of the modern OpenGL programmable pipeline (i.e.
            using shaders). Features several sophisticated software architecture patterns, notably the entire system
            backbone is built on an event queue which allowed me to use multi-threading for individual systems. Also
            features Lua scripting integration.
