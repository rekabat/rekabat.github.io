        {\sl DR-Planner} \\
        A large, academic, \cpp\ code-base, independently coded and architected by myself for my doctoral research. Used to quickly find realizations of rigid, 2D bar-joint graphs.
        \begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=0pt] \itemsep -2pt
            \item Implemented self-created algorithms, suitable for industry CAD software.
            \item Lead author on scientific paper, published in CAGD.
        \end{itemize}

        \smallskip\smallskip

        {\sl EASAL} \\
        A large, academic, \cpp\ code-base for exploring the assembly landscape of molecules (and other physical structures.)
        \begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=0pt] \itemsep -2pt
            \item Led the restructuring and refactorization of this project; this allowed for accelerated development with undergraduate students.
            \item Contributed to the user guide and feature summary, to be published in TOMS.
        \end{itemize}

        \smallskip\smallskip

        {\sl Game Engine} \\
        An independent project, in \cpp. Implemented from the ground up (using only minimal windowing and asset loading libraries.) Features: sophisticated software architecture patterns, multi-threading, and a deep understanding of the modern OpenGL
        % programmable
        pipeline.

        \smallskip\smallskip

        {\sl LolCupid} \\
        An online app developed with one partner. Features: dynamic website powered by Ruby on Rails, attractive UI, large PostgreSQL database (\mytilde 90k users), daily tasks for updating database via calls to Riot Games API, and more.
